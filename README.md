# üåü **AI-Driven Route Optimizer**

**Welcome to SmartRoute!**  
In the ever-evolving world of logistics and supply chain management, **SmartRoute** stands as a beacon of efficiency. Our AI-driven tool is designed to revolutionize the way sales vehicles navigate, optimizing routes to ensure maximum efficiency, reduced fuel consumption, and real-time traffic adaptability. 

## üöÄ **Project Overview**
SmartRoute is not just a tool; it's a game-changer. By integrating cutting-edge AI algorithms with dynamic visualization, SmartRoute ensures that every delivery is optimized for success.

- **Optimization Mode:** Our AI models crunch the numbers to deliver routes that maximize potential sales while keeping costs to a minimum. Think of it as your sales fleet‚Äôs personal navigator, always finding the best path forward.
- **Recommendation Mode:** Need strategic advice? SmartRoute provides recommendations on where to place distribution points, how many vehicles you need, and the best mix of vehicle types to hit your sales targets‚Äîall while staying cost-effective.
- **Visualization:** Powered by Streamlit and Mapbox, our tool offers an interactive visualization of routes, delivery points, and distribution centers. See the bigger picture and dive into the details with ease.

## üí° **What Powers SmartRoute?**
Our project is built on a solid foundation of synthetic data, inspired by research on vehicle routing problems. We customized this data to fit the unique challenges we aimed to solve.

### **Tech Stack:**
- **Azure Maps:** The backbone of our routing capabilities.
- **Azure Machine Learning:** Training our custom k-NN model to perfection.
- **Azure Notebooks:** Where ideas are prototyped and data is dissected.
- **Azure App Service:** Seamless web deployment for our user-friendly interface.

## üèÜ **Hackathon Glory**
**SmartRoute** was our submission for **QuantumX24**, a prestigious hackathon organized by New Horizon College of Engineering, Bengaluru. Our team, **TechTriad**, pushed the boundaries of what's possible in real-time route optimization. We experimented with various approaches before perfecting our custom heuristic algorithm, making SmartRoute both powerful and efficient.
